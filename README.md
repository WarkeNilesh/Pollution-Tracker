# POLLUTION MONITORING SYSTEM

                         “Breathe healthily and be healthy”
The level of pollution has increased with time by a lot of factors like the increase in 
population, increased vehicle use, industrialization, and urbanization which results in 
harmful effects on human well-being by directly affecting the health of the 
population exposed to it. To monitor In this project we are going to make an IOT 
Based Air Pollution Monitoring System in which we will monitor the Air Quality 
over a web server using the internet and will trigger an alarm, & take primary stemps when the air quality 
goes down beyond a certain level.
